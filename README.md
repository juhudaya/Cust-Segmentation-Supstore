# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis (Quantiles Method and K-Means Clustering

Here are the steps in this Clustering Projects :

   ## Data Preparation

   * Creating Recency DataFrames
   * Creating Frequency DataFrames
   * Creating Monetary DataFrames
   * Creating RFM DataFrames

   ## RFM Analysis with Quantiles Method

   * Calculate RFM Quantiles
   * Creating Segments using Quantiles
   * Create RFM Segmentation Table
   * Calculate RFMScore and Generate Clusters

   ## RFM Analysis Using K-Means Clustering

   * Define K Value for clustering
   * Fitting Model Predicting CLuster
   * Cluster Visualization
   * Cluster Evaluation

  ## Cluster Exploration

   * How many Customer for each group/cluster?
   * How does each cluster/group contribute to the company's revenue?
   * What is the common stock ordered in each group
   * When does each cluster usually made an order?
   * How does each cluster react on a discounts?


### With Quantiles Method i get the result:

Best Customers:  30
Loyal Customers:  159
Big Spenders:  198
Almost Lost:  14
Lost Customers:  8
Lost Cheap Customers:  74

### With RFM Analysis Using K-Means Clustering got five grup clustering :

## How does each cluster react on a discounts?

Insight :

* Recommendation for “Best Customers" segment: Focus on increasing customer purchases therefore it is necessary to form a cross/Up Selling Strategy.
* Recommendation for “Loyal Customers" segment: The business team must optimize the budget campaign and the time campaign for this customer segment in order to maintain their loyalty and increase their value.
* Recomendation for "Big Spenders" segment : Big spender shave always been among the most highly valued customers. Price isn t an issue to them, and they always want to get their hands on the best products no matter how much they cost. Focus on personalized services to make them feel extra special.
* Recommendation for “Almost Lost" segment: This customer segment is very at risk for churn, so focus on activating customers and making repurchases by forming a Reactivation Strategy, Retention Strategy.
* Recommendation for “Lost & Lost Cheap Customers" segment: This customer segment has churned, so the focus of the campaign is to reactivate the customer by forming a Reactivation strategy.
